// |             | Time complexity | Space complexity |   |   |
// |-------------|-----------------|------------------|---|---|
// | loop        | O(n)            | O(1)             |   |   |
// | recursion   | O(2^n)          | O(n)             |   |   |
// | memoization | O(2n)           | O(n)             |   |   |
//
//
// The memoization version will take O(n) time on first run,
// 		since each number is only computed once. However, in exchange,
// 		it also take O(n) memory for your current implementation
// (the n comes from storing the computed value, and also for the stack on the first run).
// If you run it many times, the time complexity will become O(M + q)
// where M is the max of all input n and q is the number of queries.
// 		The memory complexity will become O(M), which comes from the array
// which holds all the computed values.
//
//
// The loop(iterative) implementation is the best if you consider one run,
// 		as it also runs in O(n), but uses constant amount of memory O(1) to compute.
// 		For a large number of runs, it will recompute everything,
// 		so its performance may not be as good as memoization version.
