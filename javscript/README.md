### Bottom-up algorithms
Going bottom-up is a way to avoid recursion, saving the memory cost that recursion incurs when it builds up the call stack.
Put simply, a bottom-up algorithm "starts from the beginning," while a recursive algorithm often "starts from the end and works backwards."

### Memoization
Is an optimization technique used primarily to speed up computer programs by storing the results of expensive function calls.
